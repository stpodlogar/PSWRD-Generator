# PSWRD Generator

Simple terminal application to generate strong random passwords for online security. :lock

## Future things I'd like to implement:

- Ask user for minimum amount of numbers and special characters
- Implement a GUI (possibly with Tkinter)
- Allow user to copy password to their clipboard
